In the SpinCalc copy that I included herein, I had to fix the bug contained in line 238, otherwise it would not work with N>1 (see my 29 jan 2013 postings on http://www.mathworks.it/matlabcentral/fileexchange/20696-function-to-convert-between-dcm-euler-angles-quaternions-and-euler-vectors). 

I warned John Fuller about this bug and many others, but he fixed only a few of them, so I was forced to publish my (hopefully bug free) version.
